    <h2>1. Project Description</h2>
    <p><strong>CampusReclaim</strong> is a modern, web-based lost and found management system specifically designed to
        streamline the process of item recovery within university environments. In a bustling campus setting, students
        frequently lose essential items like ID cards, electronics, and study materials, while finders often struggle to
        locate the rightful owners.</p>
    <p>The platform provides a centralized, secure, and intuitive portal where campus members can immediately report
        lost items or list found belongings. It features a real-time, searchable "Public Feed" that allows users to
        browse items by category and location. To ensure trust and security, the system incorporates a multi-role
        authentication system where administrators can moderate reports and monitor community activity. By replacing
        fragmented social media posts and physical notice boards with a structured digital ecosystem,
        <strong>CampusReclaim</strong> significantly increases the success rate of item recovery and fosters a stronger
        sense of community responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Objectives & Scope</h2>
    <h3>Objectives:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bridge the communication gap between students who lose items and those who find them.</li>
        <li>Provide a centralized, searchable database for campus-wide lost and found activity.</li>
        <li>Automate the status tracking of items from "Active" to "Resolved."</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scope:</h3>
    <p>PHP-based web portal featuring user authentication, multi-role access (Admin/User), real-time search feed, and
        image upload capabilities. Designed for responsive mobile and desktop use.</p>

    <h2>3. Technology Stack</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), Vanilla JavaScript (Custom SPA Router)</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> PHP (RESTful APIs)</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL</li>
        <li><strong>UI Assets:</strong> FontAwesome 6.4, Google Fonts (Outfit)</li>

    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The <strong>CampusReclaim</strong> project successfully addresses the critical need for a structured and reliable
        lost and found system within a university environment. By transitioning from informal, fragmented reporting
        methods to a centralized digital platform, we have significantly streamlined the recovery process for students
        and staff alike. Throughout the development of this full-stack application, key technical challenges—such as
        multi-role authentication, responsive UI design using Glassmorphism, and secure file handling—were successfully
        overcome. This project not only demonstrates the practical application of PHP, MySQL, and modern JavaScript but
        also highlights the importance of user-centric design in solving community-level problems. Ultimately,
        CampusReclaim fosters a more connected and responsible campus culture, providing a scalable foundation for
        future improvements in campus management systems.</p>

    <h2>8. Future Enhancements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time Notifications:</strong> Integration with WebSocket or push notification services to alert
            users the moment a matching item is reported.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Powered Matching:</strong> Utilizing machine learning and image recognition algorithms to
            automatically suggest potential matches between "Lost" and "Found" records based on visual features.</li>
        <li><strong>GIS & Interactive Mapping:</strong> Implementation of a campus map interface where users can pin the
            exact location where an item was lost or found for better spatial awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Reward & Gamification System:</strong> A system to acknowledge and reward honest finders with campus
            credits or digital badges to encourage community participation.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-University Scaling:</strong> Expanding the database architecture to support multiple campuses
            or universities within a single, unified network.</li>
        <li><strong>In-App Messaging:</strong> A secure, anonymized chat system that allows finders and owners to
            communicate and arrange handovers without sharing personal contact details.</li>
    </ul>
